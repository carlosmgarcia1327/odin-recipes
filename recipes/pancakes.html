            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk texture; whisk together.
                Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy).
                Let rest for 3 minutes and gently stir again.</li>
            <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel.
                (You want just a bit of sheen; don't overgrease the griddle).
                Sppon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bibbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
                Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</li>    
        </ol>
